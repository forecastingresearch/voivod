To use this package, install `devtools` and in your voivod directory, run `devtools::install()`. Then you can import it like any other library (`library(voivod)`).

Use `VoI_log` if your respondents only provided the triad P(U), P(U|C), P(C). Use `VoI_log_updatable` if your respondents provided P(U), P(U|C), P(U|~C), P(C). See notes in the documentation.
